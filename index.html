        <p>Hello everyone, let me quick introduce myself. <br>
            My name is Kate, I'm 25 years old, originally I'm from Ukraine (if someone doesn't know Ukraine it's a huge country
            in Europe :). </p>
       <img src="ukraine-23600_960_720.png" alt="Ukraine on the map"> 
       
            <p>I moved to US 3 years ago. First I came to Alaska and after few month I moved to Seattle. </p>
        
        <p>In Ukraine I finished Banking University, but actually never worked at the bank. After University because of war I was forced to move, but this is not sad story of my life. I love US and happy to be here..I love traveling and if
            you too, GO do it together!!! </p>
        
        <p>Regarding work experience, I started working as a student. And during all this years I tried myself in different spaces. First job I got in jewelry company, first as a seller and after as Customer relations manager. When I came to US I use to work at fish company, few schools, retailers and also Blueprint which is Technology company. </p>
        
        <p>After years jumping from one space to another I decided that I want to do something cool. I here I am. </p>
